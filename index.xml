      <description>Introduction Github Pages, where this site is hosted, recommends Jekyll, but by the name alone it&amp;rsquo;s clear that Hugo is far superior.
This is based on Rich Youngkin&amp;rsquo;s 2020-08-31 guide.

      <description>Welcome to my little corner of the World Wide Web. The design is deliberately sparse: my attempt at bringing the simplicity (and, on most modern hardware, speed) of Web 1.0 design with consideration for newer developments like CSS, semantic HTML, and responsive design. This is also my first attempt at web design generally, so I can&#39;t guarantee that everything will work as expected across all devices. I have long been reluctant to post photos of myself, so please enjoy the ASCII art.</description>
